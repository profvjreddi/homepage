Technical knowledge in machine learning systems—or any field—is essential, but it's only one dimension of successful research and scholarship. The journey through graduate school and beyond demands a broader set of skills: the ability to read and synthesize complex literature, communicate ideas effectively, manage time, and navigate academic careers thoughtfully.

This guide is a curated collection of resources that address these important but often under-discussed aspects of academic life. The materials span from seminal works that have guided multiple generations of researchers to contemporary discussions of productivity and scientific communication.

Many of these resources originated in computer science and engineering contexts, with each section focusing on a distinct aspect of academic life and presenting authoritative sources that have proven particularly valuable for graduate students and early-career researchers.

## Why These Skills Matter

### The Hidden Curriculum of Graduate School

Graduate school teaches you to become a researcher, but much of what you need to succeed isn't explicitly taught in courses or covered in your program's handbook. While you'll learn the technical knowledge of your field through coursework and research, the meta-skills—how to read effectively, manage your time, communicate your ideas, and navigate academic careers—are often left for you to figure out on your own.

These skills can make the difference between a fulfilling, productive PhD experience and years of struggle. They're what separate students who thrive from those who merely survive.

### Beyond Technical Knowledge

The most successful researchers aren't just technically competent—they know how to:

- **Read strategically** through vast amounts of literature to find what matters
- **Communicate clearly** so their ideas have impact beyond their immediate field
- **Manage their time and energy** to sustain long-term research projects
- **Navigate academic politics and career decisions** with intention and wisdom
- **Present their work** in ways that engage and convince audiences

These skills compound over time. A PhD student who learns to read papers efficiently in their first year will process exponentially more knowledge than one who struggles with every paper. Someone who learns to give clear presentations will build stronger collaborations and get better feedback on their work.

### Learning from the Best

The resources in this guide come from researchers who've not only achieved technical excellence but also learned to excel at the human side of research. They've figured out how to do impactful work consistently, and more importantly, they've taken the time to share what they've learned. I myself try to practice these from time to time. 

Richard Hamming's "You and Your Research" isn't just about doing good research—it's about understanding what makes the difference between good researchers and great ones. David Patterson's guide on having a "bad" career uses humor to highlight the common pitfalls that derail promising researchers.

These aren't abstract theories. They're hard-won insights from people who've succeeded at the highest levels of research and want to help others do the same.
