![PhD Expectations](/images/blog/phd-expectations.png)

PhD programs teach you how to do research, but they rarely explain what's expected of you in the advisor-student relationship. Who drives what? Who owns what? What does success actually look like? Students usually discover the answers through trial and error, or through conflict that could have been avoided.

This post tries to make those expectations explicit. Not as a set of rules, but as a framework for understanding what makes PhD advising work.

## What a PhD Thesis Really Is

The most common misunderstanding is about what defines a PhD.

A PhD is not defined by time spent in a program. It's not defined by papers published. It's defined by whether you've made a scientific contribution that the community recognizes as advancing knowledge.

The thesis is a coherent argument about what you've contributed to your field. The question it must answer is: *What do you know now that nobody knew before, and why should the field care?*

This is why time alone doesn't equal completion. Three years of hard work doesn't automatically produce a thesis. Neither does a stack of papers. A thesis is ready when the contribution is clear, defensible, and meaningful.

I remember a conversation with my own advisor during my PhD. I had fifteen papers and felt ready to graduate. He told me that as long as I couldn't articulate a coherent vision, it didn't really matter how many papers I had. He was right. The thesis isn't a count of outputs. It's a claim about what you've figured out that matters.

## It's Your Thesis

This is the part that often takes students time to internalize: the PhD is yours. Not your advisor's. Yours.

Your advisor's job is to mentor, guide, challenge, and support. They'll help you navigate the field, sharpen your thinking, and connect you to opportunities. But they're not going to hand you a research agenda and tell you to execute it. The ideas, the direction, the vision: these have to come from you.

This doesn't mean you're alone. Good advising is a dialogue. Your advisor has context you don't have yet. They've seen what works and what doesn't. They understand the landscape of the field. Trust that when they push back or redirect, there's usually a reason, even if it's not immediately obvious.

But at the end of the day, you're the one writing the thesis. You're the one who has to stand up at your defense and explain what you've contributed. That ownership has to start early, not the week before you file.

The students who thrive are the ones who understand this. They propose ideas. They drive projects forward. They come to meetings with analysis and options, not just questions. When something isn't working, they diagnose why and propose alternatives. They treat their advisor as a resource, not a manager.

## The Advisor-Student Relationship

This is a partnership, and it goes both ways.

You should expect your advisor to be available for substantive discussions. To give you honest feedback about where you stand. To advocate for you when you're ready. To help you understand the landscape of the field and develop taste for what problems matter.

If you're not getting these things, that's worth raising. Advisors aren't perfect. They have competing demands, limited time, and blind spots. But they should be engaged in your development.

The flip side is that your advisor has context you don't. They've seen students succeed and fail. They understand patterns in the field that aren't obvious from inside a single project. When they push back on something, it's worth asking why before dismissing it.

The best advising relationships are genuine partnerships. The student drives, and the advisor guides. Both parties communicate honestly. Problems get raised early, before they become crises. There's mutual respect and shared investment in the outcome.

This doesn't happen automatically. It takes effort from both sides. But when it works, it's one of the most formative relationships of a research career.

## Why Peer Review Matters

Students sometimes ask: why does my thesis need to include peer-reviewed work? Why can't I just write up what I've done and defend it?

The answer goes back to what a thesis actually is. You're claiming that you've made a contribution to knowledge. But who decides if something is actually a contribution? You can't be the sole judge of your own work. The community has to validate it.

Peer review is the mechanism by which the field says: yes, this is novel, this is rigorous, this matters. When your thesis includes peer-reviewed publications, you're not just asserting that your work is good. You're demonstrating that the broader research community has examined it and agreed.

Your defense committee relies on this external validation. They're experts, but they may not be deeply specialized in your exact area. Peer-reviewed publications signal that others who are deeply specialized have already vetted the work. It shifts the question at your defense from "is this work valid?" to "does this body of work constitute a coherent contribution?"

This is also why the quality and venue of publications matter. A paper in a top venue signals stronger community validation than a paper in a less selective one. It's not about prestige for its own sake. It's about the strength of the evidence that your contribution is real.

## What Makes a Strong Thesis Statement

A thesis statement is the core claim of your dissertation. It's what you're arguing the field should now believe, based on the evidence you've gathered.

Students often struggle with this. They describe their work instead of staking a claim. But a thesis statement isn't a summary of what you did. It's a position you're defending.

**Weak thesis statements describe. Strong thesis statements claim.**

Here are some examples from machine learning systems:

*Weak:* "This thesis explores techniques for accelerating neural network inference."

This tells us the topic, but not what you've figured out. What should we believe after reading your thesis that we didn't believe before?

*Strong:* "Hardware-aware neural architecture search can reduce inference latency by an order of magnitude compared to accuracy-optimized architectures, with minimal accuracy loss, by treating latency as a first-class optimization objective rather than a post-hoc constraint."

This makes a specific claim. It identifies what the current approach gets wrong (treating latency as a constraint rather than an objective), states what the thesis demonstrates (order-of-magnitude improvement), and explains why (the reframing). It's falsifiable. It's something you can defend.

*Weak:* "This thesis presents several systems for distributed machine learning training."

Again, descriptive. What have you learned? What should we do differently?

*Strong:* "Current distributed training systems waste 30-40% of compute on redundant gradient communication. Gradient compression with error feedback can recover this waste without accuracy degradation, enabling equivalent model quality at significantly lower cost."

This identifies a problem (wasted compute), makes a quantitative claim (30-40%), and stakes a position on the solution (compression with error feedback recovers it). It tells the reader what belief they should update after reading your work.

The pattern for strong thesis statements:
1. Identify what the status quo gets wrong or misses
2. State clearly what your work demonstrates
3. Indicate the magnitude or significance
4. Be specific enough that someone could disagree

If you can't articulate a thesis statement like this, you may not be ready to defend. If you can, you've found your contribution.

## The Breadth of PhD Work

A PhD involves many activities beyond writing thesis chapters. You'll build systems, run experiments, mentor undergraduates, review papers, attend conferences, give talks, contribute to open source, organize reading groups, and collaborate with others in the lab. Not all of this will appear in your thesis. That's fine. It's still part of the training.

The thesis itself is usually a specific contribution within a broader body of work. You might spend years building infrastructure, running pilots, and exploring dead ends before the central insight emerges. The thesis captures the insight and the evidence for it. It doesn't have to capture everything you did.

This is where students sometimes get confused. They think that any work that doesn't directly "count" toward the thesis is wasted. It isn't. The skills you develop, the reputation you build, the collaborations you form: these compound over time. Researchers who only optimize for their own papers often find themselves isolated when it comes time to find jobs and collaborators.

Breadth should complement depth, not replace it. If you're only doing service work and not developing deep expertise, something is off. But if you're treating anything outside your narrow thesis topic as a distraction, you're missing the point of PhD training.

## When Projects Get Stuck

Every research project hits walls. Experiments fail. Approaches don't pan out. This is normal. It's what research feels like.

What matters is how you respond.

Sometimes the problem is technical. You haven't found the right approach yet, and you need to iterate. Other times the problem is external. The community isn't ready for your idea. Reviewers don't understand what you're doing. The work falls between fields, and neither field knows how to evaluate it.

This is especially true for interdisciplinary work. If you're working at the intersection of machine learning and systems, or any other combination of fields, you'll face this repeatedly. Reviewers from one community may not appreciate contributions legible to the other. You may need to submit multiple times, to different venues, to find reviewers who understand what you're doing.

This is painful. It can also be where true innovation happens. The most impactful work often sits at boundaries, precisely because those boundaries are underexplored. If your work is genuinely novel, don't be surprised if it takes time for the community to catch up.

When you're stuck, don't wait passively for your advisor to fix things. Come with your diagnosis. What have you tried? Why didn't it work? What options do you see? Your advisor can help you think through the landscape, but the initiative has to come from you.

And if you've concluded a project is a dead end, say so clearly. Articulate why. What's specifically broken? Is the premise flawed? Are there barriers that can't be overcome? Is the contribution too incremental? A clear diagnosis opens up options. Pivoting is fine. Giving up without analysis is not.

## Quality Over Quantity

There's a common anxiety among PhD students: how many papers do I need to graduate?

This is the wrong question.

The goal isn't to maximize your publication count. The goal is to produce work that's coherent, deep, and durable. Work that meaningfully advances the field.

I would much rather see a student produce two or three substantial pieces of work than a longer list of incremental submissions. Depth compounds. Each deep piece of work builds expertise, reputation, and foundation for what comes next. A scattershot of shallow papers doesn't build anything.

This doesn't mean moving slowly for its own sake. It means investing the time to do things right. When a paper is ready, you'll know. So will your advisor.

## Getting There

So how do you actually finish?

You drive it. You own the vision. You take initiative. You treat setbacks as problems to diagnose, not reasons to wait for rescue.

You communicate with your advisor. You raise concerns early. You come with proposals, not just complaints. You trust that they're trying to help, even when the feedback is hard to hear.

You balance depth and breadth. You invest in the community, not just your own papers. You understand that the thesis is one part of a larger education.

And you remember that this is your PhD. Your contribution. Your name on the cover. Nobody can want it more than you do.

The expectations are high and often unclear. The relationship with your advisor is unlike any you've had before. But when it works, when you understand your role, communicate honestly, and drive your own work, it's one of the most formative experiences of a career in research.

That's what a PhD is for.

*If you're a prospective or current PhD student, I hope this helps clarify what to expect. And if you're an advisor, I'd be curious to hear whether this matches your experience or where you see it differently.*
