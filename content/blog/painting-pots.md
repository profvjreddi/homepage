## For PhD Applicants During Interview Season

If you're preparing for PhD interviews, you're probably polishing answers about why you want to work on specific technical areas—ML accelerators, distributed systems, quantum computing, or whatever fascinates you. That passion is important, but there's a deeper understanding of PhD education that can transform how you approach interviews and think about your research journey.

Before diving into interview prep tactics, let me share a perspective that has helped many students reframe what a PhD really means. It's an analogy that might change how you answer the fundamental question every interviewer will ask: "Why do you want to pursue a PhD?"

## The Art Studio Analogy

Imagine you walk into an art studio and tell the experienced artist mentor, "I want to learn how to paint that blue ceramic pot sitting in the corner."

The mentor smiles and asks, "Why that specific pot?"

You might say, "Well, I love the shape; the color is fascinating, and I've seen other people paint similar pots."

The mentor nods and responds, "That pot is beautiful. But let me share something with you. When you study here, you won't just learn to paint that pot. You'll learn color theory—how pigments interact, how light affects perception, and how to mix colors to create exactly the shade you envision. You'll study composition—how to balance elements in space, direct the viewer's eye, and create depth and dimension.

You'll learn different mediums—oils, watercolors, acrylics—each with its own properties and possibilities. You'll study brushwork techniques that apply not just to pots, but to landscapes, portraits, and abstracts. You'll learn to see differently—to understand how forms relate to each other, how shadows fall, how textures can be captured.

Most importantly, you'll learn the process of artistry itself: how to experiment, learn from failures, develop your own style, push boundaries, and create something new. The pot isn't the goal—it's the vehicle for learning these fundamental skills.

By the time you finish your studies, yes, you'll be able to paint that blue pot—but you'll also be able to paint anything else you can imagine. More than that, you'll be able to envision and create things that don't even exist yet.

This is what a PhD is really about.

## What the Mentor is Really Looking For

Just like the art mentor, your potential PhD advisor isn't primarily concerned with whether you already know how to "paint the specific pot." They're looking for something deeper:

**Caliber and intellectual curiosity** - Do you ask thoughtful questions? Do you show genuine excitement about understanding how things work? Can you think critically about problems?

**Raw talent and potential** - Do you demonstrate the ability to learn quickly, make connections between ideas, and approach problems systematically?

**The right mindset** - Do you understand that research involves uncertainty, failure, and iteration? Are you comfortable with not knowing the answer and excited about finding it?

The specific technical skills—the "mechanics" of your field—can be taught, assuming you have the necessary background. Most advisors know that a curious, talented student can learn whatever technical tools they need. But curiosity, intellectual rigor, and research intuition are much harder to develop if they're not already there.

This is why the mentor in our analogy doesn't quiz you extensively on color theory or brush techniques. They're more interested in how you think about the pot, why it intrigues you, and whether you're ready to embrace the broader journey of learning.

## Translating the Analogy to Research

When you say you want to work on accelerators, memory systems, ML compilers, or distributed training, that's like saying you want to paint the pot. It's a fine starting point! But through studying these systems, you'll learn something much broader and more valuable.

Say you want to work on ML accelerators or quantization—that's your 'pot.' Through this work, you'll learn far beyond hardware design. You might dive into ML compiler optimization, discover new ways to partition neural networks, or invent novel data flow patterns. If you're passionate about distributed ML training, your journey might lead to fundamental insights about system bottlenecks, network protocols, or new algorithmic approaches to reduce communication overhead.

### The Real Skills You'll Develop

The technical focus is just your starting point. What you'll really learn is:

* How to identify meaningful research questions  
* How to break down complex problems into solvable components  
* How to design rigorous experiments  
* How to analyze and interpret results  
* How to communicate complex ideas effectively  
* How to build on existing knowledge to create something new  
* How to adapt and apply your skills to new challenges

These skills will serve you well no matter where your journey takes you—whether you stay in ML accelerator design, pivot to distributed systems, or venture into emerging fields we haven't imagined yet. Your initial technical focus is simply your canvas for learning something far more valuable: how to be a researcher who can identify unsolved problems, innovate solutions, and create new knowledge that pushes boundaries.

When approaching a PhD program, think beyond the specific technical area you're interested in. Consider how that area will serve as your training ground for developing these broader, fundamental skills. Show that you understand that while you might start with memory systems, you're signing up to learn how to ask and answer questions nobody has answered before.

*Remember: The pot is just the beginning. In the end, what you'll have created won't even fit in a pot.*

## How This Changes Your Interview Approach

Understanding this broader purpose should transform how you present yourself in interviews:

### Instead of saying:
*"I want to work on ML accelerators because they're fascinating and the field is growing rapidly."*

### Try something like:
*"I'm drawn to ML accelerators as my starting point because they sit at the intersection of hardware design, systems optimization, and algorithmic efficiency. I see this as a rich domain for learning how to identify performance bottlenecks, design rigorous experiments, and create solutions with real-world impact. I'm excited about the technical challenges, but I'm really applying to develop the research skills that will let me tackle whatever fundamental problems emerge in computing over the next decade."*

### Questions to Prepare For:

**"Why do you want a PhD?"** Don't just talk about the technical area. Explain that you want to learn how to do research that pushes boundaries, not just apply existing techniques.

**"What if your research direction changes?"** This is where the pot analogy shines. You can show that you understand PhD training is about developing transferable research skills.

**"Where do you see yourself in 10 years?"** Emphasize the skills you'll develop, not just the specific technical domain you'll master.

## The Takeaway for Applicants

When you walk into your interview (virtual or otherwise), remember: they're not just evaluating your technical knowledge or passion for a specific area. They're assessing whether you understand what you're signing up for and whether you have the mindset to succeed at the deeper challenge of becoming a researcher.

Show that you understand the difference between wanting to work on ML accelerators and wanting to learn how to identify and solve fundamental problems that don't have textbook answers. The former makes you a good student; the latter makes you a promising PhD candidate.

*The pot is just the beginning. In the end, what you'll have created won't even fit in a pot.*

**Good luck with your interviews!**
