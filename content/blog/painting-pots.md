Before I advise you on how to best prepare for a PhD Zoom interview call, I want to share a perspective that helps many students understand what a PhD truly means. Often, students come to interviews focused on a specific technical area they want to master. While that enthusiasm is great, it misses the broader purpose of Ph.D. education - and understanding this purpose can transform how you approach both the interview and your future research journey. Let me explain with an analogy:

---

Imagine you walk into an art studio and tell the experienced artist mentor, "I want to learn how to paint that blue ceramic pot sitting in the corner."

The mentor smiles and asks, "Why that specific pot?"

You might say, "Well, I love the shape; the color is fascinating, and I've seen other people paint similar pots."

The mentor nods and responds, "That pot is beautiful, indeed. But let me share something with you. When you study here, you won't just learn to paint that pot. You'll learn about color theory - how different pigments interact, how light affects perception, and how to mix colors to create exactly the shade you envision. You'll study composition—understanding how to balance elements in space, how to direct the viewer's eye, and how to create depth and dimension.

You'll learn about different mediums - oils, watercolors, acrylics—each with its own properties and possibilities. You'll study brushwork techniques that apply not just to pots, but to landscapes, portraits, and abstracts. You'll learn to see differently - to understand how forms relate to each other, how shadows fall, how textures can be captured.

And most importantly, you'll learn the process of artistry itself - how to experiment, how to learn from failures, how to develop your own style, how to push boundaries and create something new. The pot isn't the goal - it's the vehicle through which you'll learn these fundamental skills.

By the time you finish your studies, yes, you'll be able to paint that blue pot - but you'll also be able to paint anything else you can imagine. More than that, you'll be able to envision and create things that don't even exist yet.

This is what a PhD is really about.

So, when you say you want to work on accelerators, memory systems, ML compilers, or distributed training (I'm using computer architecture and ML systems examples since that's what we do), that's like saying you want to paint the pot. And that's a fine starting point! But understand that through studying these systems, you'll actually be learning something much broader and more valuable.

Say you want to work on ML accelerator or quantization—that's your 'pot.' Through this work, you'll learn far beyond just hardware design. You might find yourself diving into ML compiler optimization, discovering new ways to partition neural networks, or inventing novel data flow patterns. Or you're passionate about distributed ML training—your journey might lead you to fundamental insights about system bottlenecks, network protocols, or even new algorithmic approaches to reduce communication overhead.

The technical focus is just your starting point. What you'll really learn is:

* How to identify meaningful research questions  
* How to break down complex problems into solvable components  
* How to design rigorous experiments  
* How to analyze and interpret results  
* How to communicate complex ideas effectively  
* How to build on existing knowledge to create something new  
* How to adapt and apply your skills to new challenges

These skills will serve you well no matter where your journey takes you. Whether you stay in ML accelerator design, pivot into exploring distributed systems, or even venture into emerging fields we haven't imagined yet. Your initial technical focus, be it ML compilers or memory systems, is simply your canvas for learning something far more valuable: how to be a researcher who can identify unsolved problems, innovate solutions, and create new knowledge that pushes the boundaries of what's possible.

So, when approaching a PhD program, think beyond the specific technical area you're interested in. Consider how that area will serve as your training ground for developing these broader, more fundamental skills. Show that you understand that while you might start with memory systems (or your current favorite topic), you're signing up to learn how to ask and answer questions nobody has answered.

*Remember: The pot is just the beginning. In the end, what you'll have created won't even fit in a pot.*

## **The Takeaway**

When approaching a PhD program, think beyond the specific technical area you're interested in. Consider how that area will serve as your training ground for developing these broader, more fundamental skills. Show that you understand that while you might start with memory systems (or your current favorite topic), you're signing up to learn how to ask and answer questions nobody has answered.
