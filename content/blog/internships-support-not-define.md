![Internships and research direction](/images/blog/internships.png)

A student recently asked me about an internship opportunity, and I realized there's a lot that doesn't get effectively communicated to PhD students about internships. This post is my attempt to address that gap.

Internship season is approaching, and if you're like most PhD students, you're probably seeing opportunities pop up through department emails, from labmates who interned somewhere, or through industry connections reaching out. Companies with impressive names like Google, Meta, Apple. Interesting sounding projects. Good compensation. It's natural to feel excited and want to apply.

But before jumping at an opportunity, we need to ask a fundamental question that often gets overlooked: **What is this internship actually for?**

I see a common pattern: a student doesn't yet have a clear research direction, an exciting internship opportunity appears, they take it hoping it will help them find their direction, and then their dissertation ends up being shaped by what a company needed two years ago rather than questions they're genuinely passionate about exploring.

Let me be clear from the start: internships can be incredibly valuable. I did many during my own PhD, and I actively work with industry partners to create opportunities for my students. But I've learned from experience and from watching many students that timing and strategy matter enormously.

So let's talk about how to think about internships in the context of your PhD journey.

---

## The Problem: When Internships Define Your Research

Here's what I want every PhD student to understand: **you need to focus on developing your own research direction first, then think about internships as a way to strengthen that direction.**

When you don't have your own direction yet and jump at whatever internship opportunity appears, you're essentially letting companies determine your research agenda. And while those companies have interesting problems, they're focused on their needs, not necessarily on what will make for a compelling, coherent PhD.

I've watched this pattern play out many times:

1. Student isn't quite sure what they want to work on yet
2. An exciting internship opportunity appears
3. Student takes the internship hoping it will help them find their direction
4. Student spends 3 to 6 months working on the company's problem
5. Student returns and continues working on related problems because that's now what they know
6. Student's dissertation ends up being shaped by what a company needed 2 years ago

**The internship ended up defining the research agenda, rather than supporting it.**

This doesn't mean the student did bad work or that the internship was wasted. But it does mean they missed the opportunity to develop their own research vision, to identify questions they're genuinely passionate about, and to build a PhD around problems they chose rather than problems that happened to be available.

Here's what concerns me most: **the hard work of finding your research direction can't be outsourced to an internship.** It has to come from sustained engagement with problems, deep reading, technical exploration, and yes, some struggling and uncertainty. Once you get into the internship cycle without a clear direction of your own, it's easy to keep following that path. You do one internship, gain some expertise in that area, so the next opportunity in that space feels natural. Before you know it, your PhD is defined by a sequence of what was available rather than what you're passionate about investigating.

## What Internships Should Actually Be

Here's what made my internships valuable during my PhD: my research direction came first, and the internships supported it.

### A Personal Example: The PIN Compiler Story

Let me give you a concrete example. During my PhD, I worked on the [PIN dynamic binary instrumentation compiler](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/tool/pin-a-dynamic-binary-instrumentation-tool.html) at Intel for several years. That became a significant part of my research contribution. But here's the key: **the work didn't start with an internship. It started with a class project.**

I was taking Code Generation and Optimization, and I worked on dynamic instrumentation techniques for a project. I became genuinely interested in the problem space, dug deep into the technical challenges, and developed my own approaches. That work and the questions I was asking led to connections with [Robert Cohn](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=c-_q7y8AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra) at Intel, who became a mentor on PIN. Because I already had a clear direction and demonstrated expertise from my class project, the internship opportunity became a natural extension to collaborate with the team and mature work I was already invested in.

**The research direction came from academic exploration, not from industry telling me what to work on.** The internship then provided access to real world use cases, experienced engineers, and production contexts that strengthened that research.

### Other Examples: Class Projects That Changed Fields

This pattern isn't unique to my experience. Think about some of the most impactful contributions in computer science:

**[LLVM](https://llvm.org/)**: Chris Lattner's LLVM compiler infrastructure didn't come from an industry internship. It started as a class project and research work at the University of Illinois, driven by ideas about compiler design and optimization. It later became foundational to Apple's toolchain and countless other systems, but it began with academic research exploration.

**[AlexNet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlexNet)**: The deep learning breakthrough that kicked off the modern AI revolution came from Alex Krizhevsky's work as a graduate student, explored through academic projects which really spun out of him taking a GPU programming class. It wasn't an industry directed effort. It was academic research that then transformed industry.

Today everybody wants to work on deep nets and machine learning. But if you trace it back, the fundamental contributions came from academia. Imagine if Geoffrey Hinton had been too busy producing what a company wanted instead of pursuing his ideas about neural networks that most people thought were dead ends. Imagine if Alex Krizhevsky had been doing incremental improvements on existing computer vision systems for a company instead of experimenting with GPUs and deep architectures. Imagine if Chris Lattner had been focused on quarterly deliverables instead of reimagining compiler infrastructure. None of them would have changed their fields.

The pattern is clear: transformative work often comes from academic exploration where students have the freedom to pursue interesting ideas without immediate product constraints. Industry partnerships can amplify and validate that work, but the creative direction typically emerges from academic freedom.

**The ideal sequence:**

1. You dig into a research area and develop your own questions and perspective
2. You start making progress on technical work that's distinctly yours
3. An internship opportunity arises that lets you see how your ideas play out in practice
4. You return with deeper understanding, new constraints to consider, and validation (or refutation) of your approach
5. Your PhD work is strengthened by this real world perspective, but remains fundamentally your agenda

In this scenario, the internship accelerates and enriches your path. It doesn't create the path.

## The Industry Reality: Short Term Thinking Dominates

Students often tell me they want internships to see "real" research being done in industry. I think it's important to understand what kind of research actually happens in most industry settings today.

### The Pressure for Near Term Results

Industry is very interested in near term results, especially in AI. The field is moving so fast that companies are under enormous pressure to ship products, improve metrics, and deliver value on quarterly timelines. This creates a strong bias toward incremental improvements on known problems rather than exploratory, high risk research.

While there are still industry labs doing excellent fundamental research, the pressure to hit near term goals is intense and growing. Sure, every lab starts off saying we want to be pioneers, but the reality is that things are changing faster, especially in AI, and the economic pressures are real.

### The Changing Landscape of Industry Research

It's worth understanding the history here, because it reveals a clear trend. (For deeper reading, see Jon Gertner's [The Idea Factory](https://www.amazon.com/Idea-Factory-Great-American-Innovation/dp/1594203288) on Bell Labs' rise and fall ([NYT review](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/20/books/the-idea-factory-by-jon-gertner.html)), and this [Atlantic article on the decline of corporate research](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/11/diminishing-returns-science/570664/).)

**Bell Labs** was the gold standard of industrial research for decades. They gave researchers incredible freedom, long time horizons, and the space to pursue fundamental questions. This produced the transistor, Unix, the laser, information theory, and nine Nobel Prizes. But Bell Labs as a pure research institution no longer exists. It was gradually dismantled as AT&T faced competitive pressures and couldn't justify long term research without immediate commercial application.

**Microsoft Research** followed a similar trajectory. In the 1990s and 2000s, it was a haven for researchers who wanted academic style freedom with industry resources. They published prolifically in top venues and tackled foundational problems. But even MSR has evolved. While still excellent, there's now much more emphasis on impact to Microsoft products and tighter integration with engineering teams. The purely exploratory research groups have shrunk.

**DeepMind** was founded with the explicit mission to solve intelligence and make breakthrough scientific contributions. They've achieved remarkable things: AlphaGo, AlphaFold, and fundamental contributions to reinforcement learning. But even DeepMind is transitioning. Publishing papers is becoming quite challenging for researchers there. The pressure to contribute to Google's products and demonstrate business value has increased significantly.

**The pattern is clear:** even the best industry research labs face relentless pressure toward shorter time horizons and more applied work. This isn't a criticism of these organizations. They're responding to economic realities. But PhD students need to understand this context when thinking about where their research direction will come from.

### Why Research Timelines Matter

Good research, especially in areas like computer architecture and systems, is typically 5 to 7 years ahead of what industry needs today. Look at most successful professors and you'll notice their work isn't immediately applicable. Quantum computing researchers are working on systems that won't be commercially viable for years. Memory systems researchers are designing architectures for chips that don't exist yet. ML systems researchers are solving problems for models that are just starting to be trained.

This is exactly what makes the research valuable. By the time those systems, chips, or models exist, the research has already explored the design space and identified the solutions.

Here's the reality: some of these ideas will work, some won't click ever, and some probably won't click for another few decades. Think about how it worked out for deep learning. People like Geoffrey Hinton, Yann LeCun, and Yoshua Bengio were working on neural networks through the AI winter, when most people thought these ideas were dead ends. For years, decades even, this work wasn't producing the results that would excite companies or funding agencies. But had those researchers not done their work, pursuing ideas that seemed impractical at the time, we wouldn't have all the excitement around AI today. The field needed that long term exploration.

If you're working on problems that companies need solved right now, you're probably not doing research that will shape the field. You're doing engineering. Valuable engineering, but not the kind of long term thinking that defines research careers. A PhD is about learning to become a researcher who can identify and solve fundamental problems, not about mastering a specific technical area. (If this perspective is new to you, read my post on [Painting Pots: What a PhD Is Really About](painting-pots.md)).

## The Big Name Company Trap

Let's talk about something that happens all the time: students see Google, Meta, or Apple on an internship posting and immediately want to apply, regardless of whether the work aligns with their research.

I get it. These are prestigious companies. Having them on your CV looks impressive. But here's what students often don't realize: **just because you do an internship at a big name company doesn't mean you'll qualify to be hired there later.**

### The Hiring Reality

Many large tech companies deliberately separate their internship programs from their hiring pipelines. Google, for instance, generally has separate teams for hiring and for managing interns. The team you intern with isn't necessarily the team making hiring decisions later. They're often looking for warm bodies to fill incremental work: someone to run experiments, implement the next iteration of an existing system, or validate an approach they've already decided on.

This isn't necessarily bad work, but it's important to understand what it is. You're helping them execute their roadmap, not developing your own research agenda. And at the end, you don't automatically have a pipeline to a job there.

The reality is this: companies are strategic about how they use interns. They get valuable short term contributions at relatively low cost. Some interns do get hired, but it's usually because they demonstrated exceptional skills that happened to align with open positions, not because the internship itself guaranteed anything.

### What Actually Matters for Getting Hired

When top research labs and companies hire full-time researchers, they're looking at your body of work, your research taste, and your ability to identify and drive important problems. They want to know:

- Can you identify problems that will matter in 5 years, not just what's hot today?
- Do you have a coherent research vision, or just a collection of one-off projects?
- Can you drive research independently, or do you need someone to tell you what to work on?

A resume with "Google," "Meta," and "Microsoft" internships but no clear research thread often raises more questions than it answers. What were you actually working on? Was there continuity? Do you have your own research agenda, or have you just been executing whatever various teams needed?

Conversely, a student with a clear, coherent research direction and a strong publication record in that area will be competitive at top companies regardless of whether they interned there.

**The lesson: choose internships based on whether they strengthen your research, not based on the company logo.**

---

## Work With Your Advisor on This Decision

Here's something students often miss: when you're applying for internships, there are all kinds of places you can apply. Lots of places have internships. But that doesn't necessarily mean they're good choices for you.

What you really want to think about is what the internship is providing in terms of value. The best internships are opportunities to work with some of the best people in specific labs, on problems that matter. This is not a decision you should generally be making by yourself. **You should coordinate this with your advisor.**

Your advisor knows which are the most successful labs. Your advisor usually knows what problems interesting research labs are working on and where. Your advisor has been in the field long enough to know which groups produce strong work and which are just big names with mediocre research. You don't know what you don't know. Part of the PhD program is to leverage that knowledge and network.

Otherwise, you could end up working at a big company doing verification work or incremental engineering tasks. While meaningful, these aren't setting you up for a strong research trajectory. They won't lead to publications or help you develop the skills that make you competitive for research positions later.

When you find an opportunity that interests you, talk to your advisor. Ask: Is this lab known for good work? Does this align with my research? Will this strengthen my profile? Your advisor can help you navigate these questions and might even facilitate connections to better opportunities you didn't know existed.

## When Is the Right Time?

So when should PhD students do internships? Here's my general framework:

### Year 1: Probably Too Early

First-year students are still building foundations, exploring the landscape, and figuring out what excites them. An internship at this stage usually just delays this crucial exploration period. Exception: if you already have a clear research direction from previous work (e.g., you did substantial research as an undergrad or master's student).

### Year 2-3: It Depends

This is where it gets nuanced. If you've identified your research area and started making progress on a specific problem, an internship can be incredibly valuable. You have enough context to evaluate what you're seeing and extract lessons relevant to your work.

But if you're still trying to figure out your direction, you're better off spending the summer making real progress on your PhD research. The clarity you need won't come from an internship - it comes from doing the hard work of identifying questions, trying approaches, and developing your own technical taste.

### Year 4+: Often Valuable

By this point, you should have a clear research agenda and substantial progress. Internships now serve clear purposes: validating your ideas in real world settings, building industry connections for your next career move, or exploring how your research translates to practice. You're experienced enough to shape the internship to serve your needs rather than being shaped by it.

---

## The Sequencing Matters

Here's what I tell my students when we discuss internships:

1. **First, do the work.** Dig into a specific technical problem. Struggle with it. Make some progress. Develop opinions about what matters and what doesn't.

2. **Develop your own point of view.** You should be able to articulate not just what you're working on, but why it matters and what your unique approach is.

3. **Then, when opportunities arise, evaluate them strategically.** Does this internship let you test your ideas? Will it give you access to data, systems, or expertise you can't get academically? Will it strengthen your existing research direction?

4. **Make sure you're driving the relationship.** When you go into an internship with a clear agenda, you can shape the project to serve your PhD rather than just executing someone else's roadmap.

The critical move is sequencing things well. Internships aren't bad. Poorly timed internships are. The opportunity isn't to avoid them, but to sequence them so they accelerate your path rather than define it.

**When evaluating an opportunity, ask yourself:**
- Do I have my own research questions and direction that genuinely excite me?
- Does this internship let me test my ideas or access resources unavailable in academia?
- Can I shape the project to serve my PhD goals, or am I just executing someone's predetermined plan?
- Is this problem relevant to the 5 to 7 year research timeline, or just an immediate product need?
- At my thesis defense in 3 to 4 years, will this be part of a coherent narrative or an awkward detour?

If you can't answer these questions clearly, you're probably not ready yet.

## The Hidden Cost: Juggling Multiple Projects

Here's something students often don't anticipate: when you do a good internship, the project doesn't just end when you return to campus. **Good internships continue**, and that's actually a positive thing when managed well. You build relationships, the company is excited about your contributions, and there's valuable work to continue.

But here's the challenge: you probably put some of your PhD work on hold when you left for the internship. Now you're back, and you need to pick up that shelved project AND continue the internship collaboration. Suddenly you're juggling multiple active projects.

### The Fan Out Problem (FO4)

In computer architecture, we talk about [fan out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fan-out): how many things connect to a single point. In your PhD, think about your fan out. How many active projects are you trying to drive simultaneously?

**A useful heuristic: try to keep your research fan out to 4 or fewer (FO4).** More than that, and you're likely not making substantial progress on any of them. You're context switching constantly, each project moves slowly, and nothing reaches the finish line.

When you add internship projects into this mix without a clear strategy, you can easily find yourself with:
- Your original PhD project (that you shelved)
- The internship project (continuing collaboration)
- Maybe a course project or collaboration you committed to
- A new direction your advisor wants you to explore

That's already at the FO4 limit, and it's a recipe for slow progress on everything.

**The lesson:** Before taking an internship, think about what you'll put on hold and whether you can actually afford to split your attention when you return. Sometimes saying not now to an internship means making faster progress toward graduation.

---

## The Reality of Funding and Obligations

Here's something many students don't fully understand about the PhD: **you're funded by specific funding sources, and that means work needs to get done.**

When you receive a research assistantship, you're being paid because there's a research project with deliverables, often from federal grants (NSF, DOE, DARPA, etc.), industry sponsors, or other sources. These grants have timelines, milestones, and expected outcomes.

Your advisor wrote proposals promising to investigate specific problems. Program managers are expecting results. Future funding for the lab depends on delivering on current commitments. This is just how research funding works.

**What this means for internships:**

A 3 month summer internship plus ramp up and wind down time effectively removes about 5 months from the project funding you. For a one year grant, that's nearly half the duration. This affects not just your timeline, but potentially other students in the lab and future funding prospects.

I'm not saying you can't do internships - but you need to understand the broader context. When you discuss internship timing with your advisor, they're not just thinking about your individual trajectory. They're thinking about:

- Deliverables owed to funding agencies
- Other students depending on your work
- Equipment or resources that were purchased for the project
- Collaborators expecting progress
- Future proposals that depend on preliminary results

**The right approach:** Have honest conversations with your advisor about:
- What projects you're funded on and their timelines
- When natural breaks in the work exist (e.g., after a major submission)
- How an internship fits into the project's deliverable schedule
- Whether the internship actually advances the funded research direction

Sometimes an internship aligns perfectly with your funded project - for instance, if you need to validate your approach on industry-scale data that the internship provides access to. Other times, it's a detour that makes meeting commitments much harder.

Understanding these realities helps you make more informed, strategic decisions that work for everyone.

## I Want to Support You

I realize this post might read as discouraging or restrictive. That's not my intent.

I **want** you to do internships. I **want** you to have incredible experiences working with smart people on important problems. I work hard to create these opportunities because I believe in their value.

But I want you to get the **most** out of these experiences, and that happens when you're ready for them. When you go into an internship with a clear sense of your own research agenda, you can extract far more value. You can evaluate what you're seeing, connect it to your own work, and return with insights that accelerate your PhD.

If you're still figuring out your direction, I'd rather you spend this summer making real progress on that crucial work. Dig into a specific problem. Read deeply. Build something. Struggle with the technical challenges. **That** work is what will give you the foundation to make internships truly valuable.

The internship opportunities will still be there next year. But if you rush into them before you're ready, you risk spending your PhD working on problems that were interesting to a company two years ago, rather than problems you're genuinely excited to spend years of your life pursuing.

### If You're Reading This and Worried You're Behind

If you're in Year 2 or 3 and still don't have a clear direction, don't panic. You're not doomed. But you do need to take action now:

1. **Talk to your advisor honestly** about where you are. Use the framework from my post on [effective research meetings](effective-research-meetings.md) to have a productive conversation about finding direction.

2. **Pick something and commit** to it for at least 3 to 4 months. You can't find your direction by surveying broadly forever. Pick a specific problem, dig in, and see if it resonates with you.

3. **Focus your summer on this**, rather than on an internship that will further delay this crucial work.

The best time to find your direction was Year 1. The second best time is now.

### A Note for International Students

I recognize that international students face additional pressures around internships, specifically around CPT (Curricular Practical Training) and OPT (Optional Practical Training) for building work experience in the U.S., as well as potential immigration pathways.

These are real constraints, and I don't want to dismiss them. However, the core principles of this post still apply:

- **Strategic internships that align with your research** can provide both the work experience you need AND advance your PhD
- **Random internships just to get experience** might check a box for work history but won't necessarily help with either your PhD or competitive job placement
- **The strongest position for any job market** (including immigration dependent ones) is having a clear, coherent body of research work

If you're navigating visa considerations, I'd encourage you to:
1. Talk with your international student office about strategic timing
2. Discuss with your advisor how to align internship opportunities with your research
3. Focus even more intensely on developing strong research direction early, so when you do internships, they strengthen rather than fragment your profile

Your visa situation adds constraints, but it doesn't change the fundamental advice: build your research identity first, then use internships strategically to strengthen it.

---

## Final Thoughts

This conversation about internships is really about something more fundamental: **who is driving your PhD?**

The strongest students I've worked with found their direction through sustained engagement with problems that fascinated them, then used internships to deepen and validate that work. The internship didn't tell them what to research. It gave them a richer context for the research they were already passionate about.

That's the difference between internships supporting your research and internships defining it.

If you're a student considering internship applications right now, be honest with yourself. If you have a clear direction and the internship will strengthen it, go for it. If you're hoping the internship will give you direction, your time is better spent doing the hard work of finding that direction first.

**Your PhD should be yours: your questions, your approach, your contribution. Internships can support that vision, but they shouldn't create it.**

**The internship opportunities will still be there when you're ready. But you only get one PhD. Make sure it's yours.**

---

**Note:** If you're one of my students reading this and want to discuss your specific situation, please come talk to me. This post describes general principles, but every student's situation is different. I'm always happy to think through the right timing and strategy for your particular circumstances. My goal isn't to say no to internships - it's to help you get the most value from them when the timing is right.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Internships are strategic tools, not career solutions.** They work best when they support research you're already pursuing, not when they're meant to tell you what to research.

2. **Company logos don't guarantee jobs.** Big name internships don't automatically lead to hiring. What matters is your coherent research vision and body of work.

3. **Think 5 to 7 years out.** Research that shapes the field isn't solving today's product needs. Make sure your work has long term impact.

4. **Develop your direction first.** Don't use internships to find your research direction. Use them to deepen and validate work you're already invested in.

5. **Watch your fan out (FO4).** Good internships continue after you return. Can you handle juggling the internship project AND your PhD work? Keep your active projects to 4 or fewer.

6. **Understand funding realities.** You're funded to produce specific deliverables. Discuss with your advisor how internships affect project timelines and commitments.

7. **Your PhD should tell a coherent story.** At your thesis defense, will this internship be part of your narrative or an awkward detour?
