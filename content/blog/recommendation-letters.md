![Recommendation letters guide](/images/blog/rec-letters.png)

Recently, one of my PhD students asked me what goes into a recommendation letter. It was a simple question, but as I started to answer, I realized how much crucial information we faculty take for granted. Students work incredibly hard on their research, but they often have no idea what we're actually observing and evaluating when we advocate for them.

Here's what many students don't realize: whether you're applying for an internship, fellowship, postdoc, or faculty position, people are asking about you behind the scenes. Even when you haven't explicitly listed someone as a reference, hiring committees, program officers, and potential collaborators reach out to faculty in your field asking "What do you think of [your name]?" These informal inquiries happen constantly, sometimes weekly during hiring seasons, and they carry enormous weight in academic careers.

This post is my attempt to pull back the curtain on what actually goes into these evaluations. Understanding this process can help you make more strategic decisions about how you approach your PhD and build the kind of track record that makes mentors genuinely excited to champion you.

## What Actually Goes Into a Recommendation Letter

Before diving into specifics, let me give you a roadmap of what a typical strong recommendation letter covers. When we write a letter for a PhD student, we're usually addressing these key areas:

- **Research contributions and technical abilities**: What you've accomplished and the quality of your work
- **Research independence and problem-solving**: How you handle being stuck and work through challenges
- **Collaboration and mentoring**:  How you interact with lab mates and contribute to the research environment
- **Intellectual curiosity and engagement**:  Your interest in research beyond just your own project
- **Communication and presentation skills**:  How well you explain complex ideas to different audiences
- **Response to feedback and growth**:  How you handle criticism and improve over time
- **Initiative and leadership**:  Times you've stepped up or taken on challenges others avoided
- **Comparative assessment**:  How you rank relative to other students I've advised or know

The letter weaves these themes together with specific examples and stories that illustrate each point. We are not just checking boxes; I'm building a compelling narrative about who you are as a researcher and collaborator.

## Research Contributions and Technical Abilities

**What it is:** This covers the actual research you've done - the problems you've tackled, the methods you've developed, and the results you've achieved. But it's not just a summary of your publications. Faculty are evaluating whether you can identify problems that actually matter, develop approaches that advance the field, and produce work that others will build upon.

**Why it matters:** The research landscape is littered with technically sound work that nobody cares about. What distinguishes strong researchers is their ability to pick problems that are both technically challenging and practically important. Whether you're applying for positions in academia or industry, people want to know you won't spend years optimizing solutions to irrelevant problems. The best researchers have an intuition for what will matter in 2-3 years, not just what's trendy today. This judgment about problem selection and impact often matters more than raw technical skill.

**What faculty actually write about:** We focus on impact and judgment, not just technical execution. "Rather than following the standard approach to model compression for edge devices, [Name] recognized that the real bottleneck was memory access patterns and developed a novel weight clustering technique that enabled deployment on microcontrollers with only 2KB RAM." Or: "Their insight that existing tinyML frameworks were optimized for model size but ignored power consumption led them to develop new quantization strategies that three companies have since adopted for their sensor networks." We also highlight problem selection: "Among the dozen possible research directions we discussed, [Name] consistently chose the ones that proved most fruitful - a judgment that's rare in students." Faculty also emphasize transformative potential: "Their approach to on-device AI safety is a fundamental shift in how we think about edge AI deployment, balancing safety and efficiency - I expect this work to influence the field's direction for the next decade." The highest praise is reserved for students whose work opens new research frontiers: "The framework they developed doesn't just solve the immediate problem; it creates entirely new research questions that multiple labs are now pursuing."

## Research Independence and Problem-Solving

**What it is:** This is about how you handle the inevitable moments when you're stuck, confused, or facing a problem you've never seen before. Do you immediately ask for help, spend weeks spinning your wheels, or find that productive middle ground? It's about your debugging process, how you break down complex problems, and when you know to pivot your approach.

**Why it matters:** Whether you're heading to a faculty position, a research role at Google DeepMind, or an R&D team at an AI startup, you'll spend most of your time working on systems problems no one has solved before. There's no Stack Overflow for scaling transformers to trillion parameters or optimizing inference for edge deployment. Managers and collaborators need to know you can make progress independently without constant hand-holding, but also that you won't waste months debugging performance bottlenecks when a quick conversation could redirect you. The ability to be productively stuck, making incremental progress on complex systems challenges rather than just being paralyzed, is what separates strong researchers from those who struggle.

**What faculty actually write about:** Strong letters highlight the specific moments that reveal your problem-solving process. "When their initial approach to the optimization problem failed after two weeks, they didn't just ask me what to do next. Instead, they came to me with three alternative approaches they'd researched, explained why each might work, and asked for my thoughts on which seemed most promising." Or: "They have an excellent sense of when to push through a difficult problem versus when to step back and try a completely different approach. This judgment typically takes years to develop."

## Collaboration and Mentoring

**What it is:** This is about how you interact with your lab mates, whether you help newer students get up to speed, how you handle shared resources and equipment, and whether you contribute to a positive lab culture. It includes everything from how you participate in lab meetings to whether people seek you out for advice or collaboration.

**Why it matters:** Research is fundamentally collaborative, even when you're working on "your" project. In industry, you'll be part of teams where success depends on everyone's contributions. In academia, you'll need to collaborate across labs, mentor students, and build a network of colleagues. More immediately, toxic lab members can destroy productivity for everyone. I've seen brilliant students who were net negatives for their labs because they hoarded knowledge, created drama, or made others reluctant to ask questions. Conversely, students who lift up the entire lab become invaluable, and that reputation follows them throughout their careers.

**What faculty actually write about:** Letters emphasize specific instances of generosity and leadership. "When new students join the lab, [Name] proactively offers to walk them through our codebase and experimental setup, saving me hours of onboarding time." Or: "During a particularly challenging period when three lab members were struggling with similar technical issues, [Name] organized informal troubleshooting sessions that helped everyone make progress." Faculty also note peer recognition. "Other students regularly turn to [Name] for advice" is something we can only write about students who've built real credibility with their peers.

## Intellectual Curiosity and Engagement

**What it is:** This is about your engagement with research beyond just your own project. Do you ask thoughtful questions during lab meetings about other people's work? Do you make connections between your research and what others are doing? Do you attend talks, read papers outside your immediate area, and show genuine interest in the broader research landscape?

**Why it matters:** The best researchers aren't just executing on a narrow problem - they're constantly learning, making connections across fields, and identifying new opportunities. In industry research labs, you'll need to understand how your work fits into larger product goals and technical strategies. In academia, the most successful faculty are those who can see the big picture and identify emerging areas before they become obvious. Plus, your ability to engage with diverse research areas signals that you can adapt as fields evolve, rather than becoming obsolete when your specific niche moves on.

**What faculty actually write about:** Recommendation letters capture moments that demonstrate intellectual breadth and curiosity. "During a lab meeting on ML distributed training, [Name] asked insightful questions about how the fault tolerance mechanisms might apply to their own inference optimization work, leading to a collaboration that improved both systems." Or: "They regularly attend seminars outside their immediate area and often come to me with ideas sparked by talks on hardware accelerators or database systems." Strong letters also highlight advisory value: "I frequently bounce ideas off [Name] because they ask the kind of probing questions that reveal assumptions I hadn't examined. For example, they pointed out that our caching strategy was optimized for throughput but ignored tail latency concerns."

## Communication and Presentation Skills

**What it is:** This covers how well you can explain your work to different audiences - from technical presentations at conferences to explaining concepts to undergraduates to writing clear documentation. It includes your ability to distill complex ideas into accessible language, create effective visuals, and handle questions during presentations.

**Why it matters:** Research that can't be communicated effectively has limited impact. Whether you're presenting to potential customers at a startup, explaining your work to program managers at a tech company, or teaching students as faculty, your ability to make complex ideas accessible directly affects your career trajectory. In industry, researchers who can bridge the gap between technical teams and product managers become invaluable. In academia, clear communication determines whether your papers get accepted, your talks get invited, and your grant proposals get funded. Plus, the process of explaining your work often reveals gaps in your own understanding.

**What faculty actually write about:** Strong letters include concrete examples of communication excellence. "Their conference presentation was so clear that audience members from completely different subfields were asking thoughtful follow-up questions, and unsurprisingly this led to [Name] getting the Best Presentation Award." Or: "When explaining distributed consensus algorithms to our undergraduate interns, [Name] used analogies and visualizations that made the concepts intuitive. Several students told me it was the clearest technical explanation they'd ever heard." Faculty also emphasize written clarity: "Their technical documentation is so thorough that new lab members can reproduce their experimental setup without any additional guidance."

## Response to Feedback and Growth

**What it is:** This is about how you handle criticism, implement suggestions, and show improvement over time. Do you get defensive when someone points out flaws in your approach, or do you genuinely engage with the feedback? When you receive suggestions, do you actually follow through, or do they disappear into the void? How much have you grown since starting your PhD?

**Why it matters:** Research careers are built on iteration and peer review. Whether it's code reviews at Google, paper reviews in academia, or feedback from stakeholders in industry, your ability to receive criticism constructively and improve based on it determines how quickly you'll advance. Managers want to know they can give you honest feedback without drama, and that their investment in mentoring you will actually lead to growth. The researchers who thrive are those who view criticism as valuable data rather than personal attacks. Plus, your response to feedback reveals your intellectual maturity and self-awareness.

**What faculty actually write about:** Faculty emphasize transformative moments of growth and responsiveness. "When I pointed out that their initial experimental design had confounding variables, they didn't get defensive but instead spent a week redesigning the entire study and came back with a much more rigorous approach." Or: "Over the course of their PhD, [Name] has transformed from someone who needed detailed guidance on every step to someone who anticipates potential issues and addresses them proactively." Letters also highlight attitude toward criticism: "They actively seek out criticism and treat negative feedback as valuable debugging information rather than personal criticism."

## Initiative and Leadership

**What it is:** This is about the times you step up to tackle challenges that others avoid, propose new research directions, or take ownership of problems that aren't officially "yours." It includes organizing lab activities, mentoring newer students without being asked, or volunteering to handle the messy technical infrastructure that everyone relies on but nobody wants to maintain.

**Why it matters:** In any research environment, there are always unglamorous but important tasks that fall through the cracks: maintaining shared codebases, organizing reading groups, debugging cluster issues, or bridging communication gaps between teams. The people who proactively address these problems become indispensable. In industry, initiative distinguishes individual contributors from future tech leads and managers. In academia, it's what separates students who just complete their dissertations from those who become research leaders. Taking initiative also signals that you can identify important problems independently, not just solve problems others hand to you.

**What faculty actually write about:** Letters showcase times when students went beyond their job description. "When our lab's training infrastructure kept failing, [Name] took it upon themselves to completely redesign the pipeline, improving reliability from 60% to 95% and saving the entire lab weeks of lost work." Or: "They noticed that new students were struggling with our experimental framework and created comprehensive tutorials and example code, which we now use for all incoming lab members." Faculty also highlight intellectual initiative: "Rather than just implementing the approach I suggested, they identified three potential improvements and ran experiments to test each one, ultimately developing a method that outperformed my original idea."

## The Uncomfortable Truth: You Are Ranked Against Your Peers

**What it is:** This is the uncomfortable truth that recommendation letters are fundamentally about ranking. When we write that someone is "one of the most promising students I've advised," I'm making a specific claim about where they stand relative to everyone else I've worked with. The language is carefully calibrated. There's a big difference between "solid," "strong," "excellent," and "exceptional."

**Why it matters:** You're not competing against an abstract standard - you're competing against other real people for limited opportunities. When a hiring committee reads that you're "among the top 2% of PhD students I've supervised," they're doing math in their heads about how many students that represents and what it means. Faculty jobs might have 300+ applicants; industry research positions at top labs often have similar competition. The comparative framing helps readers understand not just that you're good, but how good relative to the field they're choosing from.

**What faculty actually write about:** Strong recommendations include carefully calibrated comparative language that carries real meaning in academic and industry contexts. "In fifteen years of advising PhD students, [Name] is one of only three I would classify as exceptional researchers." Or: "Their technical maturity exceeds that of most postdocs I've worked with." Letters also provide concrete benchmarks: "While most students take 6-8 months to become productive in our research environment, [Name] was contributing novel ideas within their first month." The key is that these comparisons are backed by the specific examples from all the previous categories. The ranking isn't arbitrary; it's justified by accumulated evidence of research ability, collaboration, growth, and initiative.

## Conclusion: What This Means for You

Understanding what goes into recommendation letters should fundamentally change how you approach your PhD. You're not just completing a research project - you're building a reputation and demonstrating the qualities that will define your research career.

The good news is that most of what matters is within your control. You can choose to be the lab member who helps others succeed. You can develop the habit of asking thoughtful questions about work outside your area. You can practice explaining complex ideas clearly. You can respond to feedback constructively rather than defensively. You can take initiative on problems that matter to your research community.

But here's the crucial part: these changes take time, so you need to start working on them actively and early. Don't wait until you're applying for jobs to think about how you're perceived. Seek regular feedback from your advisor about what you're doing well and where you can improve. It's your mentor's job to help you reach your potential, but you need to create opportunities for that guidance. Ask explicitly: "What behaviors should I focus on developing?" or "How do I compare to other students at my stage?" These conversations can be uncomfortable, but they're essential for growth. And don't hesitate to tell your mentor how they can best help you as well!

The competitive reality might feel daunting, but it's also clarifying. Instead of wondering what you should focus on, you now know what your mentors are actually observing and valuing. Every interaction in your lab, every presentation you give, every response to criticism is contributing to the narrative that will follow you throughout your career.

Most importantly, remember that the behaviors that make for strong recommendation letters (intellectual curiosity, collaborative generosity, resilience in the face of challenges) are also the behaviors that make for a fulfilling research career. When you optimize for these qualities, you're not gaming the system; you're becoming the kind of researcher you'll be proud to be.

**The next time someone asks for feedback about you (and they will, more often than you realize), what story will your mentors be excited to tell?**
